# 1: Intro to Robotics (and Autonomous Racing)
Welcome! This is the first introduction to the world of robotics (especially autonomous vehicles).

This section will go over the following topics:
- [Robot: Dictionary Definition](https://github.com/daia99/TCD-FS-AI-Autonomous-Racing/blob/master/Learning/Self-Deep-Learning/1-Intro-to-Robotics-Racing.md#robot-dictionary-definition)

## Robot: Dictionary Definition
According to Google, the definition for robot is:
> (especially in science fiction) a machine resembling a human being and able to replicate certain human movements and functions automatically.

The other, more applicable definition for robot:
> a ***machine*** capable of carrying out a complex series of actions ***automatically***, especially one ***programmable by a computer***.

#### What does this mean?
A robot is not an assembly of moving parts, or a computer.

A robot is a complex body with a brain (computer) giving it adaptable intelligence to change the physical world. Body and mind working together.
